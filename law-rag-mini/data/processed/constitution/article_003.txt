Article 3 — Formation of New States and Alteration of Areas, Boundaries or Names of Existing States

Legal Text:
Parliament may by law:
(a) form a new State by separating territory from any State, uniting two or more States or parts of States, or uniting any territory with a part of a State,
(b) increase the area of any State,
(c) diminish the area of any State,
(d) alter the boundaries of any State,
(e) alter the name of any State.

Proviso:
A Bill for this purpose may be introduced only with the President’s recommendation. If the Bill affects the area, boundaries or name of any State, the President must refer it to that State’s Legislature for its views within a specified time.

Explanation I:
For clauses (a) to (e), "State" includes Union Territories. In the proviso, "State" does not include Union Territories.

Explanation II:
The power in clause (a) includes forming new States or Union Territories by uniting parts of existing States or Union Territories.

Explanation:
Article 3 defines Parliament’s power to reorganize the territory, boundaries, or names of States. It requires State Legislatures to be consulted but does not require their consent.
