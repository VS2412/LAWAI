Article 4 — Laws Under Articles 2 and 3 to Provide for Schedules and Supplemental Matters

Legal Text:
(1) Any law under Article 2 or Article 3 must contain necessary amendments to the First and Fourth Schedules and may include supplemental, incidental, and consequential provisions, including representation in Parliament or State Legislatures.
(2) Such a law is not considered a constitutional amendment for the purposes of Article 368.

Explanation:
Article 4 ensures that when new States are admitted or boundaries altered, related schedules and representations are automatically updated. These changes do not count as constitutional amendments.
