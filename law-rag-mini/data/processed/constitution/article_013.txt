Article 13 — Laws Inconsistent with or in Derogation of Fundamental Rights

Legal Text:
(1) All laws in force in the territory of India immediately before the commencement of this Constitution, insofar as they are inconsistent with the provisions of this Part, shall be void to the extent of such inconsistency.

(2) The State shall not make any law that takes away or abridges the rights conferred by this Part. Any law made in contravention shall be void to the extent of that contravention.

(3) In this article:
(a) “law” includes any Ordinance, order, bye-law, rule, regulation, notification, custom or usage having the force of law in India.
(b) “laws in force” includes laws made by a Legislature or authority in India before this Constitution’s commencement, even if not then in operation.

(4) Nothing in this article applies to constitutional amendments made under Article 368.

Explanation:
Article 13 protects Fundamental Rights by invalidating inconsistent laws and preventing the State from making laws that violate these rights. It also provides a broad definition of “law” but exempts constitutional amendments.
