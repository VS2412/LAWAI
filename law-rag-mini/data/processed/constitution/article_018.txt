Article 18 — Abolition of Titles

Legal Text:
(1) No title, except military or academic distinctions, shall be conferred by the State.
(2) No citizen shall accept any title from a foreign State.
(3) No non-citizen holding an office of profit or trust under the State shall accept any title from a foreign State without the President’s consent.
(4) No person holding an office of profit or trust under the State shall accept any present, emolument, or office from any foreign State without the President’s consent.

Explanation:
Article 18 abolishes all non-military and non-academic titles (like those used under British rule) and restricts acceptance of foreign honors.
