Article 20 — Protection in Respect of Conviction for Offences

Legal Text:
(1) No person shall be convicted of any offence except for violation of a law in force at the time of the commission of the act, nor be subjected to a penalty greater than what could be imposed at that time.

(2) No person shall be prosecuted and punished for the same offence more than once (double jeopardy).

(3) No person accused of an offence shall be compelled to be a witness against himself (self-incrimination).

Explanation:
Article 20 provides three key protections in criminal law: prohibition of retrospective criminal punishment, protection against double jeopardy, and the right against self-incrimination. These protections apply only to criminal offences.
